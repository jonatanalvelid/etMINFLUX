    Analysis pipeline that detects a slowly increasing spot-like signal (0-maximum intensity inside ~10-20 frames),
    used for detecting slow accumulation of gag signal, with a low confocal frame rate, at potential virus budding sites.
    
    Common parameters:
    img - current image
    prev_frames - previous image(s)
    binary_mask - binary mask of the region to consider
    exinfo - pandas dataframe of the detected vesicles and their track ids from the previous frames

    Pipeline specific parameters:
    min_dist_appear - minimum distance in pixels between two peaks
    num_peaks - number of peaks to track
    thresh_abs_lo - low intensity threshold in img_ana of the peaks to consider
    thresh_abs_hi - high intensity threshold in img_ana of the peaks to consider
    finalintlo = low threshold on the final intensity of the peak
    finalinthi = high threshold on the final intensity of the peak
    border_limit - how much of the border to remove peaks from
    memory_frames - number of frames for which a vesicle can disappear but still be connected to the same track
    track_search_dist - number of pixels a vesicle is allowed to move from one frame to the next
    frames_appear - number of frames ago peaks of interest appeared (to minimize noisy detections and allowing to track intensity change over time before deicision)
    thresh_stayratio - ratio of frames of the frames_appear that the peak has to be present in
    thresh_intincratio - the threshold ratio of the intensity increase in the area of the peak
    thresh_intincratio_max - the maximum threshold ratio of the intensity increase in the area of the peak
    intincslope = threshold on the slope of the intensity increase over frames_appear frames, used insted of threshold_intincratio when the data allows (long enough)
    thresh_move_dist - the threshold start-end distance a peak is allowed to move during frames_appear
